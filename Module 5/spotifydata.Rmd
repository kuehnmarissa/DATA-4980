## Load data and libraries

```{r}
library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)
data <- read_xlsx("~/Y4-25-Spring/DATA 4980 Data Visualization/DATA-4980/Module 5/spotify-2023.xlsx")
```

## Data exploration and visualization

```{r}
# Sample 5 random rows to display
sample_n(data,5)
```
```{r}
# Create dataframe grouped by artist with number of songs in the dataset and total streams
artists <- data %>% group_by(Artist) %>% summarize(songs=n(), total_streams=sum(Streams)) 
sample_n(artists,5)
```
```{r}
# Obtain top 10 artists by total stream count
top10 <- artists %>% 
  arrange(desc(total_streams)) %>% 
  slice(1:10)
```

```{r}
top10 %>%
  ggplot()+
  geom_col(aes(x=fct_reorder(Artist,total_streams),y=total_streams))+
  labs(title="Top 10 Artists",x="Artist",y="Total Streams Across All Songs in Millions") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::unit_format(unit = "M", scale = 1e-6)) +
  coord_flip()
```
```{r}
# Create dataframe grouped by year with number of songs in the dataset and total streams
years <- data %>% group_by(`Year Released`) %>% summarize(songs=n(), total_streams=sum(Streams)) 
sample_n(years,5)
```
```{r}
years %>% ggplot()+

  labs(title="Number of Songs Released By Year",x="Year Released",y="Songs Released")
```
```{r}
